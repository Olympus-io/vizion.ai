# Using cURL to Interact With Your Vizion-ELK API
Elasticsearch operates as a REST API and be interfaced with any number of tools that make http requests. For this guide,
we will use cURL, available in the Mac or Linux console, to illustrate some basic commands. Note that this guide represents a small
fraction of Elasticsearch's capabilities. Much more can be found in [the official docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html).
